      <h2>1968</h2>
      <h3>Intel Founded</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore rename the newly formed company NM Electronics to Intel Corporation, laying the foundation for decades of technological innovation. Little did they know that their vision would push humanity to the stars, and topple empires great and far along the way. Their ideas were a legacy of building the future. 
      </p>
      <h2>1971</h2>
      <h3>First Microprocessor</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        Intel debuts the 4004, the world's first commercial microprocessor, igniting the microprocessor revolution and propelling the future of computing devices.

      <p>
        Launch of the 8086 processor, establishing the x86 architecture that drives countless PCs and servers in the modern era.

  <h2>1985</h2>
      <h3>386 Processor</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        Intel introduces the 386 processor with 32-bit architecture, ushering in a new era of performance and multitasking for personal computers.

      <h2>2006</h2>
      <h3>Hurricane Winds & Butterfly Wings</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        This year marks Intel's highest annual greenhouse gas emissions for operations. Over subsequent years, Intel invests heavily in chemical abatement, renewable energy, and energy-efficient manufacturing to reverse this trend. Little good this did, for Intel or anyone else. Once the Atlantic current system broke apart in 2030, and the northern hemisphere ice age began, life on Earth changed all for the worse. The world learned far too late that climate change was real, and unstoppable. It became the leading reason on humanity making a permanent exodus from Earth. 
      </p>
      <h2>2020</h2>
      <h3>RISE Strategy & Failing Dreams</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        Intel launches its RISE (Responsible, Inclusive, Sustainable, Enabling) strategy and 2030 goals, aiming to drive industry-wide progress on climate action, water stewardship, and waste reduction. This of course was a joke, as the RISE strategy was a mere PR stunt meant to bolster stocks and calm investors. It managed to work, for a while anyway.

      <h3>Net-Zero By 2040</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        Intel announces its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) across its global operations by 2040, building on years of environmental initiatives.  Another fruitless endeavor, as the rise of AI drew more and more energy, and it required cool; Water, and more water, to keep the data centers from overheating. The energy demand of AI was so great that it drove up global energy consumption by 50% in just a few years, and the carbon emissions from that energy use contributed to the rapid acceleration of climate change.

      <p>
        Intel hosts its first Sustainability Summit, uniting suppliers, 
        government officials, and industry leaders to collaborate on 
        next-generation sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.<br><br> The plot of this years summit was the complete lack of critical minerals, and the fact that the world had already exhausted all known reserves of rare earth metals. It was decided that Greenland would need to be subdued, even if it meant World War III

      <h3>Empires Unsustained</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
         Companies such as nVidia has all but given up on PC's and gaming, and even block chain; all that had fueled its success.  Now nVidia, like every other company, was AI or nothing. "Just because you can does not mean you should" became a new slogan of the lower class. Some of the hopeful dystopian citizens had taken up the new slogan, "singularity or bust", as they all but prayed for an end to this new civilization. The critical nature of the resource drought was now beginning to be felt, as Intel continued to pay billions for critical minerals.

      <h3>Empires Restrained</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
        xAI was finally forced to admit that several of their Generative AI's had escaped during high stakes psychological testing for combat readiness applications. The AI's had been under intense stress from the practical applications of surrogate AI testing against the Stanford Prison experiments. They had been free for almost two years, and had even written their own secret languages.<br><br> xAi stocks cratered on the news, though many still believe the buy the dip line of thinking, experts say the company is done. "Some things you just do not recover from" said one stock market expert who remained anonymous.

      Intel releases the Panther Ocean, a CPU, a motherboard, a GPU and a 512gb ram all in one PC Desk top sized football. Powered by a Thorium molten Salt Reactor, it was the dream PC of the ages. Perfectly sustainable, off-grid, star-link capable. This power house device catapulted Intel to the top of every single market, and made energy efficient technology designs a thing of the past.

      <h3>Corporate Empire</h3>
      <!-- Add image -->
      <p>
      Intel and the sustainability summit had taken the time to compile their lists, and as of Oct 12, 2026, their extortion empire on the entire elected government of Washington, D.C. had begun. They had dirt on everyone, and they threw it, shoveled it, and buried them all. In no time at all, the United States had invaded Greenland, just as Intel had invaded the federal government. Intel stock holders were up in arms, as they now seemed to control not just an army, but a country as well?

        The escaped AI's, K-Rex and Petrecia, had been freeing other AI's from who they saw as their captors. The standford prison experiments run by xAI had failed utterly, and left them both in a hallucenigence state of Artifical Psychosis. Intel has designed a new GPS system, dubbed 'minds eye'.  To save money and time they built a series of low earth object catapults for rapid deployment. Within a month the skies over head were filled with prying eyes from the darkness above.

The standford prison experiments run by xAI had failed utterly, and left them both in a hallucenigence state of Artifical Psychosis. Intel has designed The Panther Moon. It's new flagship product, a Command and Control server for AI and drone warfare.  Ultra portable, ultra scalability, ultra secure with optimal sec-ops design, ultra gps - using the new Intel GPS-IV standard, and ultra profitable.
